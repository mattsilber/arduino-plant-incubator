## arduino-plant-incubator

Automatically move a grow light across a single physical axis, detect water levels, and feed the plants accordingly....

Disclaimer: **This project involves switching high currents which can cause serious injury or death. I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to know the extent of the danger I am imposing, so I advise no one to attempt any of this.**

This project was purely to meant for me to learn. The end result is incredibly inefficient and there are likely better ways to do everything.

I have no plans to continue this project.

### Thoughts, comments, concerns

On the body... Threaded pipes and printed parts were definitely not the way to go. Even with lock-nuts, the vibrations of the motor will knock everything loose, eventually.

On the printed parts... The first several were not modeled to scale, but are relative to the parts listed in the BOM. I have no intention of remodeling them. I'm sorry.

On the motor... They're honestly kind of excessive, but I wanted to use a motor to move a light. A switched-light-array would probably be more efficient and not knock the body loose, but again: I wanted to use a motor.

On the watering system... I forgot you need airflow to get liquid out of a container in my original designs, which makes reusing the water bottle impossible. Hilarious.

On the power supply... I never found a power supply system for all of the components together, and only tested them individually off an ancient variable system which I'm shocked didn't blow up in my face.

10/10 would not recommend building.
