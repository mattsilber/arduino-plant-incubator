## Bill of Materials

### Printed Parts

| File | Count | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| box-base-multi | 8 | The frame |
| endstop-holder | 2| The holders for the start/end endstop switches |
| light-cross-mount | 2 | The rod mount for the pipes holding the light |
| motor-holder | 2 | The top/bottom mount for the motor |
| pulley-idler-holder | 1 | Holds the pulley idler in place |
| pulley-idler | 1 | The idler for the timing belt |
| pulley-slider-mount | 2 | The mount connected to the timing belt which slides across the unthreaded rods |

#### Notes

The blend files need to be scaled based on the desired rod sizes.

Pieces are duplicated out of laziness, but can be used for multiple purposes.

### Rods 

* 4x threaded rods (desired width)
* 4x threaded rods (desired height)
* 2x threaded rods (desired length)
* 2x unthreaded rods (desired length)

#### Notes

5/16" threaded rods recommended, and at least 1/4" for the unthreaded.

The unthreaded rods need to be manually threaded at the ends to properly attach to the base components and endstop mounts.

### Nuts

* 28x for the threaded rods (16 for the bases, 4 for the idlers, 8 for the motors)
* 16x for the unthreaded rods (8 for the bases, 8 for the endstops)
* 2x for the idler screw

### Washers

* 46x everywhere
* 28x lock-washers (24 for the bases, 4 for the endstops)

### Circuit Components

| Name | Count | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| A4988 Motor Controller | 2 | Controls the stepper motor |
| 17HS4401S Stepper Motor | 2 | Moves the light rig |

### Power Sources

* --- for the arduino
* 8v/1A for the motor
* --- for the light
* --- for the water injection solenoid 

### Additional Physical Components
